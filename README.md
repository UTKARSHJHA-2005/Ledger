# Getting Started
<br/>
## Step 1: Clone the repository and install the dependencies

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/UTKARSHJHA-2005/Ledger.git

# Navigate to project folder
cd grocery-ledger-app

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npx react-native run-android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.
## Congratulations! :tada:
You've successfully run and modified your React Native App.
